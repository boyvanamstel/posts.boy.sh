(Right, I ignored this part of the internet for almost a year.)

I just finished [Gabriel Knight 2: the Beast Within](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beast_Within:_A_Gabriel_Knight_Mystery); the best FMV game of the 90s (I don't think they were made in any other decade). When it came out, it blew my mind. Now it looks pretty dated, but it offers such an immersive experience. The story is awesome and most of the acting is pretty good. The game's depiction of Germany, German people and American actors talking in German is especially memorable.

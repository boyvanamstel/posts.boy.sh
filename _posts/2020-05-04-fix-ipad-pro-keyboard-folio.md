My Smart Keyboard Folio has been unresponsive for months. I was almost getting ready to trash it. Every time I folded it into position, the onscreen keyboard slid up as if a physical keyboard wasnâ€™t connected at all.

It _was_ attached though and I tried everything to get it to work:

* Force-rebooting my iPad with the keyboard disconnected, then connecting it afterwards. Didnâ€™t work.
* Cleaning the contacts with alcohol and a clean cloth. Didnâ€™t work.
* Nudging it from the bottom left or right corner. Worked at first, then nothing.

The problem manifested over a few weeks, getting worse every day. I thought the ribbon cable had been damaged. Nothing I could do to fix it.

Then I tried bending the magnets that snap the keyboard into place. ðŸ§²

I couldn't believe it at first, but the problem was resolved instantly. After folding and unfolding it several times it still works. Iâ€™m actually typing this article on it.

The trick is to bend the magnets slightly towards where it connects with the iPad. Donâ€™t overdo it, just curve them up a tiny bit. I canâ€™t even see the difference on mine, but the effect is there.

So, if youâ€™ve ruled out all software-related issues, you might want to give this a go. [Let me know](https://www.twitter.com/boyvanamstel) if you got yours working again too!

I changed my workspace at home a few weeks ago. Instead of a dedicated room, I now have a closet to work in.

That's right: I fit my entire office inside of a cabinet. This includes a monitor, desktop computer, laptop, three game consoles with peripherals and a bunch of binders.

It made me think about _where_ I work on my apps. Currently there are three major workplaces that I alternate between: my closet, a desk at [Blendle](https://www.blendle.com) and random [Croissant affiliated coworking places](https://www.getcroissant.com/a/boy26)[^croissantaff]...
